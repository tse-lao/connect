# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Create a file .env in the smartContracts folder. 
Add the following variables 

**it needs to be on the mumbai polygon network**
The private key can be found in the metamask, what I suggest is creating a new account without any funds on it, put some mautic faucet to it and just experiment with this account. In case something goes wrong or you
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY= 
**use a Mumbai Polygon network account for this. **
ALCHEMY_KEY=

**you can use this token if you like, claim your tokens on connect-fast.com so you can start testing**
TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x59Ff8a97A7D1766d06c9D4A48356b3a76B78Dc18
